# QU_QUIZ

My final project for a CSCI course this semester was to write a solver for this NPR puzzle, the [QU Quiz](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/08/932548059/sunday-puzzle-the-q-u-quiz) in OCaml. That solution ended up being faster than this solution in Rust, at least my first attempt at one. 

I'm trying to get back to programming and learning Rust, because I think it's a very cool language, so I thought this would be a good first attempt to getting me back on the horse, so to say. 

The files I was given in class are provided. 

Run using `cargo run <filename>`
